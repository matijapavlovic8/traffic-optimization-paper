ABSTRACT = {YOLO has become a central real-time object detection system for robotics, driverless cars, and video monitoring applications. We present a comprehensive analysis of YOLO’s evolution, examining the innovations and contributions in each iteration from the original YOLO up to YOLOv8, YOLO-NAS, and YOLO with transformers. We start by describing the standard metrics and postprocessing; then, we discuss the major changes in network architecture and training tricks for each model. Finally, we summarize the essential lessons from YOLO’s development and provide a perspective on its future, highlighting potential research directions to enhance real-time object detection systems.},
